# infinitypool

Imagine you are a product manager. You are extremely customer-centric and so you want to keep the pulse about what your customers think about your product, how they are using it, what they like about it, etc. But surveys are expensive, limited, and take time. Imagine, instead, having a pool of customers you could survey anytime and ask them any questions. And get the answer in seconds, all for free. This is what I am trying to demonstrate here with a proof-of-concept (POC) that I call InfinityPool.
